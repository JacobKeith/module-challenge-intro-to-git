## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? A version control system
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is the program we use. GetHub is a storage for the information we create in Git.
3. Why do we create a branch? We create a Branch to contain information to workout without affecting other areas of our code.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? Allows you and others to see changes you've made to a repository on GitHub.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. git checkout and name of the branch.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? fetch checks to see if there are any changes you can pull. Pull does the same thing but copies the changes from the remote repository. Merge join two commits into one.
7. What is a merge conflict? When you merge branches that have competing changes and git needs help deciding which one to use. 
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? You must edit the conflicted file. You can use the confilct editor on github.
